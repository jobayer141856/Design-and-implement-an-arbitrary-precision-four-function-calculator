This project is a C++ console application. The project contains four functions which are addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division. In all four functions the program takes two inputs as integers except the special floating
point multiplication function. A third input of precision is to be taken. Hence, an output of desired precision is shown.
Two functions are used to standardize and set the precision of the results, which are makeStandard() and
floatToStandard().
